	  About Me
	  <p> I am the starting Varsity Goalie for Skyline High School Lacrosse. I am also an Eagle Scout which is strong in leadership. That helps me communicate
		  on the field and helped me be the chosen goalie. My goals with Lacrosse are to play D1 in college and earn my masters at a good school.
